binson-java
===========

A Java implementation of Binson. Binson is like JSON, but faster and 
even simpler. See [binson.org](http://binson.org/).


Build
=====

Build with build.xml and ANT or any other build tool.
The code in src only depends on the JVM (Java 6 should work).

The tests in src-test depends on JUnit (junit-4.12.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar).
